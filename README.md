# JWPlayerKit-IssueReproduction
Ever-more comprehensive Demos of JWPlayerKit (JWP iOS SDK v4.x)

For security, the .gitignore has a "SecureKeys.swift" entry. It is built to read from a struct:
```swift
enum Secure {
    enum Keys {
        static let v4LicenseKey = "{your license key here}"
    }
}
```

Or feel free to change how you enter your license key. :)
